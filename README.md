# HACKING.md for Error Handling in Golang

A `HACKING.md` file is a document with technical information that provides guidance for contributors to **understand**, and to **make changes** to a project.

This [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) file is the _default_ `HACKING.md` file that I use for **error handling** in the **Go programming-language** (**golang**).

This `HACKING.md` file can also be imported into an `AGENTS.md` and `SKILLS.md` file.
