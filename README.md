# HACKING.md for Error Handling in Golang

A `HACKING.md` file is a document with technical information that provides guidance for contributors to **understand**, and to **make changes** to a project.

This [HACKING.md](HACKING.md) file is the `HACKING.md` file that I use for **error handling** in Golang.

This `HACKING.md` file can also be imported into an AGENTS.md file.
